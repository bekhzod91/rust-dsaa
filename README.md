# Rust-DSAA (Data structures and algorithms)

### Description

This repository contains implementations of data structures and algorithms in Rust. My goal is to implementation of all popular data structures and algorithms in Rust. 

### Data structures
  [x] [Stack](#stack-lifo) \
  [ ] Queue \
  [ ] Linked List \
  [ ] AVL Tree \
  [ ] BTree \
  [ ] Graph \
  [ ] Hashing \
  [ ] Heap \
  [ ] Binary Search \
  [ ] Fibonacci \


## Stack (LIFO)

[src](src/stack.rs) \
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
