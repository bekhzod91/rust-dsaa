# Rust-DSAA (Data structures and algorithms)

### Description

This repository contains implementations of data structures and algorithms in Rust step by step. The goal is to learn Rust and refresh my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

## Stack (LIFO)

[src](src/stack.rs) \
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

## Bubble Sort
[src](src/bubble_sort.rs)\
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

## Bubble Sort
[src](src/bubble_sort.rs)\
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

## Selection Sort
[src](src/selection_sort.rs)\
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the biggest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the end of the sorted list.

## Binary Search
[src](src/binary_search.rs)\
Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array. In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.
